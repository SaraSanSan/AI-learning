# STAY INFORMED ABOUT AI

## Module 5 introduction: Stay ahead of the AI curve

Part of staying knowledgeable
involves learning about innovative uses of AI.
One thing that excites me
is how AI continues to develop in new ways.
This means there's always more to learn:
more tools, more examples of how people
have integrated AI into their work,
more guidelines on how to use AI responsibly,
and even new types of models.
Staying informed about new developments in AI
can empower you to use it more effectively.
My name is Sharbani and I'm a Senior Director
in the Core Machine Learning group at Google.
That means the teams I work with
build the infrastructure and tooling
that helps you build and produce amazing AI innovations
faster and easier.
I'm excited to help you learn more
about how to stay current with developments in AI.
First, you'll learn how to evaluate new AI tools.
You'll explore inspiring AI innovations
and consider how others have integrated AI in their fields.
Lastly, you'll identify opportunities
to leverage AI in the workplace.
I hope you're excited to continue this journey
and explore strategies to stay up to date with AI
as it advances into the future.
Let's begin. 


## Sharbani: The future of AI

Hi, I am Sharbani.
I'm a senior director
in the Core Machine Learning Group at Google.
The Core Machine Learning Group
runs all of the infrastructure that our science teams need
to be able to build great innovation like the PaLM model
or the upcoming Gemini model.
My background is I'm a pretty standard-issue nerd.
I've always loved science and math.
I ended up studying physics and mathematics undergrad.
I worked in physics labs all through college.
I just gravitated to hard problems,
and I think machine learning is a field that is ripe
with a lot of hard, high-impact problems.
It's just mad, like how fast things are accelerating.
When you look at traditional business planning and say,
"Let's plan our long-term vision," right?
So you're saying, "Okay, what's the right
timeline for that?"
Three years, right?
We're looking at three months as a long-term timeline
because things are changing so quickly.
So you see people starting to innovate
and dream at a pace like never before.
Access to AI has become so much easier
for everyone in their everyday lives.
The barriers to have to get it started
or to figure out how it works
just don't exist like they did before.
And anybody can be interacting with AI in a very natural,
conversational way, which just means having almost like
that thought partner that's just there alongside you.
The best way to get started with any of these AI tools
is just to pick a problem you have in your everyday life,
try it out, see how it works.
For me, one of the best things about working in AI
is all of the possibilities for the future
that I get to dream about and actually start delivering on.
One of the most inspirational things for me
to really focus on when I think about the customer needs
that are really gonna drive innovation in the future,
is around accessibility.
So like a classic everyday world example of that
is a curb cut at the corner of a street.
When you have a sidewalk
and you don't just have a step down,
but you have almost kind of this ramp,
that was made to help people who are in wheelchairs
be able to go up and down.
When you then think about how that helps everyday lives,
that helps people with strollers, wheelchairs,
and it just makes everyone's life better.
So I think about things like on live video calls
when you have live captioning,
it can then be transformed into something
that's not just being able to better read
what someone is saying, but then if someone's speaking
a different language, you can still be speaking
in one language and they can be speaking in another,
and you can still be having a real-time communication.
You think about how it can break down barriers
and improve access and independence
across everything that we have to do in our daily lives,
the possibilities are endless.

# TRY NEW AI TOOLS

## Anoop: Become AI-empowered

My name is Anoop.
I am a director of AI and future technologies at Google.
Director of AI and future technologies means
I focus on thinking about where AI
and other technologies will be used
to improve the user experience in the future.
20 years ago, I did my PhD in artificial intelligence
and human computer interaction.
If you told me 20 years ago, we'd be seeing the type
of artificial intelligence technology
that we're seeing today, I wouldn't have believed it.
AI, I think right now, is like a bullet train.
Every week there's some innovation that seems tremendous.
It's actually very difficult to keep up with it
as a researcher enough so that,
you know, sometimes I use AI itself to help me keep track
of summarizing the things that are actually happening.
It's hard to say if it's comparable
to the birth of the internet since
it's so early in its current form.
But I would say that the opportunity for AI
to transform the way individuals are working
and also the way individuals are learning is actually equal.
AI tools are a fantastic way
to improve your professional growth and development.
First is in just improving your own productivity.
Sitting down in front of tools that you can use
to help you draft a paper,
to synthesize a set of research that you're doing.
AI can be used to help you create new content
and new designs.
You can use image creation tools today
to create ideas that are in your imagination using
just text-based prompts.
AI assisted coding can actually help you
tackle harder problems
because what it does is it'll give you suggestions
for ways to approach certain problems
as well as help you in the skills you'll actually need
to understand how to actually tackle them.
There are tools today,
they're actually easy to sit down and use.
They can be very fun to use
and then they can lead to a transformative change.
In recent times with the era of large language models,
I am using them to help me draft, to write,
to even edit what I've actually written,
and I really find that capability to help my productivity
as well as help me become a better writer.
I remember one article that I had to write
and it was an article trying to describe
what was happening in the AI industry,
and I was at the end of the day needing to complete this,
and I said, "Okay, let me sit down in front
of the LLM and get some hints."
And it probably saved me most of my evening,
to actually get the early drafts
and early thinking collaboratively with the AI system.
All of those tools, they aren't a replacement for what I do
because I need my own expertise to double check
and collaborate with the AI systems.
But you know, I do find them actually quite helpful.
The more I'm able to work on creative
and in-depth tasks, really the deep work that I'm able
to do, the more satisfied I am, really, in the work
that I'm doing. 


## Activity: Evaluate a new AI tool

### Activity Exemplar: Evaluate a new AI tool

Your Tool evaluation notes template should include the following components:

1. The Workplace needs section lists the workplace needs for a new AI tool as being able to save and reuse prompts as well as being able to incorporate variables.

2. The Tool strengths section contains a list of the relevant strengths of Google AI Studio discovered during the activity, such as that it allows the user to enter multiple input variables in a prompt and that the user can share the prompt with others.

3. The Assessment of the tool’s suitability for workplace tasks section contains a 4–5 sentence explanation of why Google AI Studio is or is not suitable for the workplace needs. It connects Google AI Studio's strengths to the workplace needs.



# LEARN FROM AI INNOVATION

## Take inspiration from AI innovation

To start innovating with AI,
consider what tasks you need to accomplish.
For example, think about what slows down your work.
Then think about how incorporating AI into your workflow
may help you meet your needs.
For inspiration,
let's discuss some innovative types of AI models
and explore their possibilities.
Med-PaLM is a large language model
that is designed to answer medical questions.
It was built based on Google's existing LLM PaLM,
but it was adapted for answering medical questions
through training with clinicians.
The Med-PaLM model is exciting
because it demonstrates the potential
for a model that already exists
like PaLM to be specialized
through training with experts in the field.
Consider how workers
in the healthcare industry may leverage this model
and how other industries
might use their own specialized models.
Some machine learning and AI tools analyze just one modality
or form of data in their input.
A multimodal model is an AI model
that can accept and learn from multiple types of input,
such as images, video, or audio.
AI tools that incorporate multimodal models
can perform additional tasks beyond what a model
that analyzes just one type of data can do.
Med-PaLM has a multimodal version called Med-PaLM M.
As a multimodal model, Med-PaLM M can do more
than answer text-based medical questions.
It can interpret several types of biomedical data,
including language, medical imaging, and genomic data.
This expands the model's potential
for use in the medical field.
Let's consider the following scenario.
You're attending a presentation,
there's a large audience,
and everyone is so interested
in every word the speaker has to say.
Observing the speaker might inspire you.
Even if you don't have the expertise
to speak on the same topic,
you might adopt some of the techniques the speaker uses.
Likewise, you can find inspiration in how others use AI.
AI is used innovatively across multiple industries,
and more and more, humans are applying AI
to create solutions to complex problems.
Robotics is another industry
where AI is frequently used in novel ways.
The startup company Refiberd is applying AI
to sensor technology to help reduce textile waste.

Refiberd developed an AI system
that uses sensors to identify
and organize different textiles in recycling plants
based on their materials.
This helps reduce the amount of waste in recycling plants.
Textiles made from certain materials can be sent
to facilities that can process them.
You can apply ideas from this example to your own work.
Even if you don't have a robot
or a need to sort physical objects in your work,
you might be inspired to use AI for sorting in another way.
For instance, you might use AI to organize workplace tasks.
Are there other kinds of sorting
or organizational tasks AI could help you with?
There are so many ways humans use AI to address questions
and improve the lives of others.
I encourage you to keep exploring
how you too can augment your work with AI. 


## Reena: Find inspiration in how others have used AI

Hi, I'm Reena, I'm Head of Content
and Partnership Enablement
for Responsible Innovation at Google.
My parents are both immigrants.
My dad's from India, my mother's from the Philippines.
They're both physicians,
and met on a fellowship in the States.
They were very science-based,
I was always the opposite of them.
I studied humanities in college, I studied English.
I was very into writing and journalism,
and was a business journalist for a while,
my beat was innovation.
So I know I have a really long title,
but my team does a lot of things.
Our primary purpose is to operationalize our AI principles.
They're basically statements
built on our mission, our values as a company,
and how we serve our users responsibly.
I and others on my team, we actually assess new applications
that are going to be integrated into products and services.
It's important to get as many points of view at the table
when you're building AI.
One thing about generative AI is that it touches
so many sectors, it touches so many different domains,
so many applications in one's daily life
that we need a lot of different experts,
and a lot of lived expertise as we're developing it.
It's very helpful for testing, it's very helpful
for batting around ideas and understanding ahead of time
what some user's concerns might be,
and how you might address 'em.
The data that our AI systems are trained on
reflect a lot of historical data.
That can mean there might be historical biases,
historical stereotypes, et cetera, that are in the data.
And so, it's really important to make sure
that we're looking at everything in today's world
from many different perspectives.
For my own team, we look across many different teams' work,
because there are a lot of people being really creative,
being really adventurous with AI right now,
it's a wide open field.
One team that I've looked at and found so much
inspiration from, it's the Google Arts and Culture team.
This is a team that works with the world's most renowned
museums and cultural institutions,
and makes their collections available online.
And they've been doing so many exciting things
that have actually inspired our work,
in terms of offering guidelines
to developing AI responsibly.
So, for example, because they work with a lot of imagery,
they've been fantastic in terms of showing outputs
from AI applications that make it really clear to users
that they're looking at an image that was generated with AI.
And so, I love working with Google Arts and Culture
because they come up with such, not only aesthetic,
but very human and very natural ways to disclose
that you're looking at something,
or reading something that was created with AI,
that feels really comfortable.
One of the best ways to learn about what's happening
in the AI field is simply to have fun, you know?
Look for exciting ways to experience AI.
Look at what your kids might be playing with.
What catches your eye?
What's fun? What brings you joy? 



# CONTINUE YOUR AI JOURNEY

## Benefits of staying up to date with AI

Humans have used AI in amazing ways already,
and the technology continues to improve every day.
Consider the telephone.
After its development,
it became increasingly common
to find telephones in residences and workplaces.
Later, this technology evolved into the mobile phones
that people could carry around with them
and extend their ability to communicate
whenever they needed to.
And now people use smartphones for a variety of purposes.
AI has a similar potential for growth.
Staying knowledgeable about AI as it evolves
can benefit you in the workplace in multiple ways.
You can use AI to improve the quality of your work,
and allow you to better meet your goals.
For instance, if you're writing a report for a team meeting,
you can use AI to help you identify
spelling and grammatical errors,
or to suggest ways to improve your writing.
This can make your report more understandable
and increase the likelihood
that your audience will be responsive to your ideas.
AI can also support
your professional growth and development.
You might leverage AI to learn a new skill.
For example, if you've wanted to learn
how to write Python code,
try using an AI tool like GitHub Copilot
to answer your questions about Python programming language.
GitHub Copilot may also give you suggestions
about how to write code.
Finally, developing AI-related skills
may help lead to professional opportunities.
The demand for AI-related professional skills is increasing
across virtually every American industrial sector.
Therefore, growing your AI knowledge and skills
may create opportunities for economic mobility.
How can you leverage AI in your work?
First, examine the tasks you do on a typical day.
Have you already learned about any AI tools
that can help you with these tasks?
Second, analyze your work process as a whole.
Which parts of your workflow typically cause problems
or take a lot of time to complete?
How might you leverage AI to address these issues?
Third, address challenges in your work process
whenever they arise.
Perhaps your team is suddenly asked
to take on a time-consuming new task
that you've never performed before.
If a problem like this occurs,
consider augmenting your process with AI.
For instance, now that you've learned
that conversational AI can summarize documents,
if you encounter a task at work that involves summarizing,
think about including AI in that process.
No matter how you incorporate AI into your workflow,
make sure you're highly involved in this process.
This means carefully considering
if AI is suitable for your task,
evaluating generated content,
and verifying its accuracy through credible sources,
and editing any AI-generated content,
rather than just copying and pasting it.
I encourage you to begin assessing
where you can start leveraging AI
in your own work processes. 


## Greg: Keep exploring with AI

I am Greg.
I'm a Research Scientist at Google,
and that means that I try to build technologies
and develop new ways to make machines intelligent.
So when I was a kid, I watched a lot of TV,
mostly kind of nerdy educational programs, like NOVA
and things like that, and I became fascinated with physics
and how the universe worked.
And despite the fact that this wasn't the sort of thing
that most people in my family did, I became convinced
that I wanted to go to a university and study physics.
In the process of my education,
I learned that the thing in the world
that I was most interested in understanding
was actually the brain and human cognition.
And so I went to graduate school in neuroscience.
I met folks who were exploring
not just how the brain worked,
but how the brain could teach us to build machines
that were more intelligent.
And I came to Google to follow those ideas,
to understand whether there were ideas from biology
and neuroscience that could help us build machines
that were smarter.
The shift from machines that only understand exactly
what they're explicitly told to machines
that can actually learn from experience or data
or mistakes has been nothing less than transformational.
Seeing how other people use a piece of technology,
use a tool, whether it's AI or something else,
gives you new ideas
about how you might use that tool, right?
It's almost like watching cooking shows.
You don't have to make the same thing
that the chef makes on the show to learn something about
how you could use this tool differently.
I really encourage people to be educated
about how the technology is useful,
because there may be something that's similar problem,
even if it comes from a different field
or a different industry.
I think that the approach to using AI in a new way
for an application or a technology,
it's actually relatively simple,
which is that you should start with play.
Start with trying to play with a toy version of the problem
and a toy solution,
and see if you can make it work in a simplified environment
or at a small scale that gives you confidence
that you can try something bigger.
Try it not for composing an entire orchestral piece.
Try it for just completing a melody or a phrase,
but if there's any advice at all,
it's to try to appreciate the opportunity
as broadly as you can and be willing to try things again.
And so there's really an opportunity to be someone
who makes a discovery, makes a discovery
about how to use a tool well, how to get a new effect
with the technology, how to use it for a new purpose.
So whether you're building AI
or discovering ways to use it,
the opportunity for innovation and creativity
is in your hands, not anyone else's.
