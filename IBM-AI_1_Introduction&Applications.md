# | INTRODUCTION AND CAPABILITIES OF GENERATIVE AI |

In this module, you will learn the fundamentals of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and how it differs from discriminative AI. You will also discover the capabilities of generative AI for generating text, image, code, speech, and video as well as for data augmentation.

Learning Objectives:

    Demonstrate use cases of generative AI for text, image, and code generation
    Describe generative AI and its evolution
    Contrast generative AI with discriminative AI
    Describe common capabilities of generative AI for the generation of text, image, audio, video, virtual worlds, code, and data
    Demonstrate use cases of generative AI for text generation.
