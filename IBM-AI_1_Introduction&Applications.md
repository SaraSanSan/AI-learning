# GENERATIVE AI AND ITS CAPABILITIES

## Introduction to Generative AI

Welcome to introduction to generative AI.
After watching this video,
you'll be able to describe
generative AI and its evolution,
you'll also be able to explain how
generative AI differs from discriminative AI.
Artificial intelligence, or AI has been around for years,
shaping almost every sphere of
our lives and revolutionizing how we live and work.
At its core, AI can be defined as
the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
AI models learn from vast amounts of existing data.
The process of learning from data is called training.
There are two fundamental approaches to AI,
discriminative AI and generative AI.
Discriminative AI is an approach that
learns to distinguish between different classes of data.
A discriminative AI model is given a set of
training data where each data point
is labeled with its class.
The model then predicts the class of a new data point by
finding the side of the decision boundary
that the data point falls on.
Discriminative AI models use
advanced algorithms to differentiate,
classify, identify patterns,
and draw conclusions based on training data.
An example of how a discriminative
AI model works can be seen in how
email spam filters can
differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.
Discriminative AI models are
best applied to classification tasks.
They cannot, however, understand context or generate
new content based on
a contextual understanding of the training data,
and this is where generative artificial intelligence
or generative AI comes in.
Generative AI models learn to
generate new content based on the training data.
They can capture the underlining distribution of
the training data and generate novel data instances.
Generative AI starts with a prompt.
This can be text, an image,
video, or any other input that the model can process.
As an output, the model generates new content,
including text, images, audio,
video, code, and data.
Generative AI can produce output
in the same form in which the prompt is provided.
For example, text to
text or in a different form from the prompt,
such as text to image or image to video.
Here is a simple example
to understand the difference between
discriminative or traditional AI and generative AI.
Discriminative AI would be
best suited to answer questions such as,
is this image a drawing of a nest or an egg?
Generative AI would respond to prompts,
such as draw an image of a nest with three eggs in it.
While discriminative AI mimics
our analytical and predictive skills,
generative AI goes a step
further to mimic our creative skills.
As implied by this comment
from the Harvard Business Review,
AI can not only boost
our analytic and decision making abilities,
but also heighten creativity.
Generative models can take what they have learned and
create entirely new content based on that information.
Both discriminative and generative models
are created using deep learning techniques.
Deep learning involves training
artificial neural networks to
learn from vast amounts of data.
An artificial neural network is
a collection of smaller computing units called neurons,
which are modeled in a manner that is similar
to how a human brain processes information.
The creative skills of
generative AI come from generative AI models,
such as generative adversarial networks or GANs,
variational autoencoders or VAEs,
transformers, and diffusion models.
These models can be considered as
the building blocks of generative AI.
Generative AI is not a new concept,
it's roots trace back to the origins of machine learning.
In the late 1950s when
scientists proposed machine learning,
they explored using algorithms to create new data.
During the 1990s, the rise of
neural networks infused advancements in generative AI.
Further, during the early 2010s,
deep learning supported by
the availability of large datasets
and enhanced computing power
further advanced the development of generative AI.
In 2014, generative AI was transformed with
the introduction of GANs by
Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues.
GANs and other models such as
VAEs and transformers set the stage for
generative AIs growth and
the development of foundational models and tools.
Foundation models are AI models with
broad capabilities that can be adapted to
create more specialized models or
tools for specific use cases.
A specific category of
foundation models called large language models or
LLMs are trained to understand
human language and can process and generate text.
In 2018, OpenAI introduced
a transformer-based LLM called
generative pre-trained transformer or GPT.
Over the years, different LLM such as
GPT-3 and GPT-4 in the GPT series,
Google's pathways language model or PaLM,
and Metas large language model,
Meta AI or Llama,
have significantly enhanced generative AI
to generate coherent and relevant text.
There have been similar developments
and models for other use cases.
For example, stable diffusion and
DALL-E models for image generation.
The development of a variety
of generative models has led to
a growing market for generative AI tools
for diverse use cases.
For instance, you have ChatGPT
and Bard for text generation,
DALL-E 2 and Midjourney for image generation,
Synthesia for video generation,
and Copilot and AlphaCode for code generation.
The rapidly emerging models and tools have generated
a wide scope for generative
AI applications across domains.
To quote from McKenzie's report on
the economic potential of generative AI,
generative AI has the potential
to change the anatomy of work,
augmenting the capabilities of
individual workers by automating
some of their individual activities.
The report also predicts that generative AI's impact on
productivity could add trillions of dollars
in value to the global economy.
In this video, you learned that
generative AI models can generate
new content based on the data they are trained on.
Further, you learned that the creative skills of
generative AI are built from models such as GANs,
VAEs, transformers, and diffusion models.
Foundation models can be adapted to create
specialized models or tools
tailored to specific use cases.
Finally, you learned that
generative AI models and tools have
a wide scope for applications
across different domains and industries. 


## History and Evolution of Generative AI

- Objectives

After completing this reading, you will be able to:

    Describe the key developments in the field of generative AI in chronological order
    Explain the current scenario of generative AI

- Introduction

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on developing algorithms to create new content, such as text, images, music, and code. Generative AI models are trained on substantial datasets of existing content and learn to generate new content similar to the data they were trained on.

- History

The origin of generative AI origins can be traced back to the initial stages of artificial intelligence exploration. In the 1950s, researchers began to explore the use of computers to generate new data, such as text, images, and music. However, the computational power and data resources needed for these systems to flourish were not yet available.

One of the earliest instances of generative AI dates back to 1964 with the creation of the ELIZA chatbot. Operating on a rule-based system, ELIZA simulated conversations with users by generating responses based on received text. While not genuinely intelligent, ELIZA showcased the potential of generative AI for human-like communication.

During the 1980s and 1990s, hardware and software capabilities advanced considerably and facilitated the development of advanced generative AI models, including neural networks. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and can learn intricate patterns in data. However, these early neural networks were computationally expensive to train and could only generate small amounts of content.

In the early 2000s, a significant breakthrough occurred in generative AI research with the advent of deep learning. Utilizing neural networks with multiple layers, deep learning models could be trained on extensive datasets to discern complex patterns, enabling the generation of new data that closely resembled human-created content. This breakthrough led to the development of innovative generative AI models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).

GANs and VAEs excel at producing high-quality content that is often indistinguishable from content crafted by humans. 

GANs operate by training two neural networks in opposition: a generator that creates new content and a discriminator that tries to differentiate between real and synthetic content. Eventually, the generator learns to craft content realistic enough to deceive the discriminator.

VAEs work by learning a latent space of the data they are trained on. The latent space is a representation of the data that captures the most essential features of the data. VAEs can generate new content by sampling from the latent space and decoding the latent code into the original data space.

In recent years, there has been a rapid explosion in the development of new generative AI models. These models can now generate a wide variety of content, including text, images, music, and code. Generative AI is also used in various applications, such as art, design, and healthcare.

One such instance is the development of diffusion models in 2015. Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to a clean image until it is completely unrecognizable. They can then be reversed to gradually remove the noise and generate a new image. Diffusion models have been used to create high-quality images and text.

The next significant development is that of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3and Bardin 2020 and 2023, respectively. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, which allows them to generate realistic text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. 2023 was also when watsonx, a superior generative AI platform based on the cloud, was introduced by IBM. Watsonx can support multiple LLMs.

high resolution new images of imaginary faces, animals, or nature.
While DeepArt can create comprehensive artwork from a simple sketch.
DALL-E can generate entirely new images as described by the users.
Apart from applications in art, design, entertainment, gaming,
and research domains, generated images can augment training, data and
aid medical imaging and scientific visualization.
In the context of audio generation, generative models can generate new
musical compositions, convert text into audio using text-to-speech or
TTS, and create synthetic voices and natural sounding speech.
Generative models can convert, modify, and transform and clean up voices,
also reduce noise and enhance audio quality.
These models also have the capability to mimic human voice to a fair amount of
likeness.
WaveGAN, for example, can create new and realistic raw audio waveforms,
including speech, music, and natural sounds.
MuseNet from OpenAI can combine various instruments,
styles, and genres to generate novel musical compositions.
Googles, Tacotron 2 and Mozilla TTS use advanced TTS systems to create
synthetic speech resembling human tone, pitch, modulation,
pronunciation, rhythm, and expressions.
Audio generated by generative models has applications in media,
creativity, entertainment, training, education, gaming, virtual reality, and
several other domains.
Now lets look at the video generation capabilities of generative AI.
Generative AI models can create dynamic and
lucid videos ranging from basic animations to complex scenes.
These models transform images into dynamic videos by incorporating temporal
coherence.
In natural language processing temporal coherence refers to the consistency and
continuity of meaning or context over time.
This enables these models to exhibit smooth motion and
plausible transitions in videos.
For instance, a popular AI model VideoGPT follows
textual prompts users provide to generate new videos.
Users can specify the desired content and guide the video generation process,
including completion, editing, synthesis, prediction, and style transfer.
These generated videos can be used in domains such as art,
entertainment, education, gaming, medicine, and research.
Now let's talk about generative AI's code generation capabilities.
Generative models can generate new code snippets, functions, or
complete programs based on desired functionality.
Trained on existing code repositories, these models can complete or create code,
synthesize or refractor code, identify and fix bugs in code, test software, and
create documentation including comments, function descriptions, and usage examples.
For instance, GitHub copilot and IBM Watson code assistant are AI based
programming assistants that help autocomplete code, accelerate hard tasks,
and generate code for provided input.
AI generated code can be used in software and web development, machine learning and
natural language processing, data science and analytics, robotics and
automation, virtual game and AR/VR environment development,
and audio, video and speech processing.
Software developers can benefit from leveraging code generation capabilities to
write, debug, and test their code.
Now let's explore the data generation and
augmentation capabilities of generative AI.
Generative models can generate new data and augment existing datasets.
Generating synthetic data sets helps increase the diversity and
variability of the data, leading to more robust and effective performance.
These models can generate new samples and augment data sets for images, text,
speech, tabular data and statistical distribution, time series, data finance,
and more.
The data generation and augmentation capabilities of generative AI
have applications in medicine, healthcare, gaming, education and
training, art and creativity, self driving automobiles, and many more.
Another powerful capability of generative AI models is their ability to create
highly realistic and complex virtual worlds.
You can create avatars that simulate realistic behavior,
expressions, conversations, and even decisions.
You can also create complex virtual environments with realistic textures,
sounds, and objects that follow the principles of the physical world.
Metaverse platforms use generative models to create unique and
personalized experiences for individual users.
Generative AI also makes it possible to create virtual identities with unique
personalities, avatars that can be fitted with specific personality traits that
reflect in their behaviors and conversations.
The virtual world capability of generative AI has applications in gaming,
entertainment, education, augmented and virtual reality metaverse platforms, and
also virtual influencers and digital personalities.
In this video, you learned about some of the capabilities
of generative AI models and their use in the real world.
Generative AI can create coherent and contextually relevant content and generate
realistic, high quality images, synthetic voices, new audio and dynamic videos.
And generative AI models can generate and complete code and
synthesize new data to augment the existing datasets.
Generative AI models are also capable of creating highly realistic and
complex virtual worlds, including virtual avatars and digital personalities.
