## AI and the future of work

In today's fast-paced world,
AI is quickly becoming a standard tool
in every company's toolkit.
Navigating the emergence of AI in the workplace is similar
to driving down a busy street.
Just as knowing the rules of the road can make you a better
and more effective driver,
understanding the basics of AI can help you
to reach your destination safely
and to avoid potential roadblocks.
To begin this AI journey, let's start by examining
what the term artificial intelligence really means.
In this context, intelligence refers
to the human ability to perform cognitive tasks.
A cognitive task is any mental activity such as thinking,
understanding, learning, and remembering.
As humans, we have cognitive abilities that allow us
to make decisions and solve problems.
However, there are also limits
to how much information we can process at a time.
AI is capable of extending our cognitive abilities,
helping us to make better decisions
and solve problems faster.
With that understanding, the term artificial intelligence
refers to computer programs
that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated
with human intelligence.
Simply put, AI programs can assist us with tasks
by using math to learn from data.
As you'll soon discover, AI has the potential
to greatly improve the quality of our work lives
and streamline business operations.
However, AI isn't a magic solution
to every business problem.
As with any advanced tool,
the key is to use AI to its strengths,
and doing so requires careful thought

# DISCOVER HOW AI WORKS

## Explore how AI uses machine learning

All the buzz surrounding AI
can make it seem like the hottest new tech trend.
But the truth is, AI has been around for a while.
For example, have you ever wondered
how streaming platforms recommend videos you might like?
This feature is brought to you by AI.
For years, streaming platforms have used AI tools
to offer services like recommendation systems
that enhance the user experience.
An AI tool refers to AI-powered software
that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks.
Examples of AI tools are everywhere,
from GPS systems that suggest quick routes
to translation systems
that interpret conversations in real time.
Companies of all shapes and sizes use AI tools
to streamline operations
and improve the quality of their products and services.
While these AI tools can seem naturally smart,
it's important to recognize that they're not self-taught.
Instead, they're powered by
what's known as machine learning.
Machine learning, or ML, is a subset of AI
focused on developing computer programs
that can analyze data to make decisions or predictions.
ML is a specialized layer
under the broader category of AI technology.
It's often used by AI tools
to make sense of data quickly and efficiently.
AI designers build ML programs using a training set,
which is a collection of data used to teach AI.
Basically, training sets provide ML programs with examples
of what to expect and how to respond appropriately.
For example, consider a food distributor
that uses an AI tool
to sort and pack ripe apples in their factory.
For this tool to work, an AI designer must first train
an ML program to identify ripe apples.
They would do this by providing their ML program
with a training set that includes thousands of images
of ripe and unripe apples.
As the ML program processes these images,
it eventually learns to identify the features
of ripe apples.
Having learned to do this with ML,
the AI tool can then identify ripe apples
that weren't in its training set
and help factory employees work more efficiently.
As I mentioned earlier, many AI tools use ML
to learn and improve their performance.
However, for ML programs to perform effectively,
the quality and relevance of their training data matter.
A fundamental issue to be aware of
is the potential for bias within training data.
This could unintentionally cause an AI tool
to produce inaccurate or unintended outputs.
For example, the AI tool that was used to sort ripe apples
might have learned from training data
that only contain images of specific types of red apples.
This would unintentionally make the AI less accurate
at identifying ripe apples
of varying sizes, shapes, or colors.
The food producer might end up sorting apples incorrectly,
causing them to lose money and waste perfectly good apples.
When used appropriately,
ML plays a key role in advancing AI into the future.
It's truly an incredible and sophisticated technique
with endless applications. 


## Foundations of generative AI

Advancements in AI technology are reshaping how we work.
Let's explore one of the key developments
at the center of this transformation, generative AI.
As the name suggests, generative AI
is AI that can generate new content
such as text, images, or other media.
A unique quality of generative AI tools
is that you can use them with natural language.
Natural language refers to the way people talk
or write when communicating with each other.
Here's a simplified overview
of how a generative AI tool works with natural language.
First, you provide input.
Input refers to any information
or data that's sent to a computer for processing.
Many generative AI tools, accept text and speeches input,
and some also accept images or video files.
Next, the data is processed by the AI tool.
Then an output is generated in the form of text,
images, audio, or video.
Generative AI and the ability to interact
with computers using natural language has introduced a world
of possibilities for what people can create with AI.
For example, you might be marketing a new business.
You need fresh, engaging content like a promotional poster
to advertise a new product,
but you don't have a creative team
to bring your ideas to life.
No need to stress.
With a few instructions,
generative AI can help you create a poster.
If the generated content doesn't meet your expectations,
you can provide additional instructions
until it produces something that meets your needs.
This is just one example
of how generative AI can complement your skills,
but there are many other ways
it can benefit you and your work.
For example, generative AI can boost your productivity
by helping you with tasks like drafting replies to emails.
It can help you avoid mistakes,
and it can improve your decision-making process
by answering questions and brainstorming ideas with you.
Whether you work in healthcare, education, finance, retail,
or any other field, there are a wide variety
of generative AI tools that can cater to your needs.
One example is a conversational AI tool.
A conversational AI tool is a generative AI tool
that processes text requests and generates text responses.
You can use it to brainstorm ideas, answer questions,
and boost your productivity.
Throughout Google AI Essentials,
you'll gain practical experience
using a conversational AI tool by Google called Gemini.
Gemini can be used
to get some creative inspiration when you're feeling stuck,
build on your ideas,
and provide detailed explanations
that help you explore topics easily.
For example, let's ask Gemini to brainstorm a list
of team-bonding activities for our summer work retreat.
The AI tool responds with a wide range of ideas
from a fun beach party to a relaxed pottery class.
Gemini also share some additional tips
to consider when planning a successful work retreat.
Generative AI has paved the way to exciting new frontiers,
but before we can tap into what this technology
has to offer, it's essential to investigate the capabilities
and limitations of AI as a whole.
Continue to the next part of this lesson to get started. 


## A guide to AI and ML

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are changing the future of work. While both terms seem similar, machine learning is actually a specific technique used by AI designers to achieve artificially intelligent computer programs. Knowing the basics of how AI and ML relate to each other can help you navigate these technologies as they transform the work landscape, enabling you to effectively contribute to AI-driven projects or lead your own AI initiatives.

In this reading, you'll explore some of the ML techniques AI designers use to build AI programs, deepening your understanding of how ML leverages data to make decisions and perform tasks. You'll also explore how ML techniques have paved the way for generative AI.

- AI development techniques

Artificial intelligence refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. There are two main techniques used to design AI programs:

1. Rule-based techniques involve creating AI programs that strictly follow predefined rules to make decisions. For example, a spam filter using rule-based techniques might block emails that contain specific keywords using its predefined logic.

2. Machine learning techniques involve creating AI programs that can analyze and learn from patterns in data to make independent decisions. For example, a spam filter using these techniques might flag potential spam for the recipient to review, preventing automatic blocking. If the recipient marks emails from trusted sources as safe, the spam filter learns and adapts its logic to include similar emails from that sender in the future.

AI tools can use either rule-based or ML techniques, or even a combination of both. In general, rule-based techniques are commonly used for tasks that require rigidity, such as blocking messages from untrusted senders that are obviously spam, like requests for bank transfers or private information. Conversely, ML techniques are better suited for tasks demanding flexibility and adaptability, like learning to recognize that messages from trusted senders containing typos are not spam.

- Approaches to training ML programs

Recall that machine learning is a subset of AI focused on developing computer programs that can analyze data to make decisions or predictions. AI designers often use ML in their AI programs because it doesn’t have the limitations of rule-based techniques.

There are three common approaches to training ML programs:

    Supervised learning
    Unsupervised learning
    Reinforcement learning

1. Supervised learning:

In this approach, the ML program learns from a labeled training set. A labeled training set includes data that is labeled or tagged, which provides context and meaning to the data. For instance, an email spam filter that's trained with supervised learning would use a training set of emails that are labeled as “spam” or “not spam.” Supervised learning is often used when there's a specific output in mind.

2. Unsupervised learning:

In this approach, the ML program learns from an unlabeled training set. An unlabeled training set includes data that does not have labels or tags. For instance, ML might be used to analyze a dataset of unsorted  email messages and find patterns in topics, keywords, or contacts. In other words, unsupervised learning is used to identify patterns in data without a specific output in mind.

1. Reinforcement learning:

In this approach, the ML program uses trial-and-error to learn which actions lead to the best outcome. The program learns to do this by getting rewarded for making good choices that lead to the desired results. Reinforcement learning is commonly used by conversational AI tools. As these tools receive feedback from users and AI designers, they learn to generate effective responses.

Each ML technique has its own strengths and weaknesses. Depending on the type of data that's available and what's needed to solve the particular problem, AI designers may use one, two, or all three of these techniques to produce an AI-powered solution.

- Generative AI

Advancements in machine learning have helped pave the way for generative AI—AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. This type of AI often uses a combination of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to create original content.

For instance, all three approaches play distinct roles in conversational AI tools. Supervised learning equips conversational AI tools with foundational dialogue data, enabling them to respond to common conversational cues appropriately. Unsupervised learning enables them to interpret nuances in language, like colloquialisms, that occur naturally in conversation. Reinforcement learning further strengthens these tools by allowing them to improve their responses in real-time based on user feedback. This enables them to adapt to the conversational context and engage in natural conversations.

Generative AI's ability to create and innovate offers a range of benefits to all sorts of workplaces and professions, such as marketing, product development, engineering, education, manufacturing, and research and development. These benefits include:

1. Greater efficiency: Generative AI can automate or augment routine tasks, allowing workers to focus on other work priorities.

2. Personalized experiences: Generative AI can tailor its interactions to individual preferences and needs.

3. Better decisions: Generative AI can quickly analyze vast amounts of data to uncover useful insights.

These are just some of the ways that generative AI can enhance your work.

## Understand the capabilities and limitations of AI

Just as you don't need to be a carpenter to use a hammer,
you don't need to be a computer expert
to use AI effectively.
That said, understanding the basics of what AI can do
will help you make the most of the technology.
Today's AI tools can do a lot to enhance your work.
They can generate content,
like assisting a marketing team
by making a promotional video for a new product.
They can analyze information quickly,
like highlighting the key points of a long email thread.
They can answer questions in a detailed and nuanced way.
And overall, they can simplify your day-to-day
and allow you to focus on other aspects of your work.
While AI can complete a variety of tasks,
there are some tasks that require a human touch,
such as handling sensitive issues.
These limitations can be critical in certain contexts.
For example, AI can't learn independently.
It needs people to continually update its training.
Shortcomings in an AI tool's training data
can also potentially reflect or amplify biases,
leading to skewed or unfair outcomes.
Another major limitation
is that AI output can sometimes contain inaccuracies,
otherwise known as hallucinations.
Hallucinations are AI outputs that are not true.
These inaccuracies can range from minor errors,
such as a sentence that doesn't make sense,
to significant distortions.
For instance, consider a sales manager
who's using an AI tool to analyze quarterly sales data.
The AI tool might identify declining sales
of a particular product,
and flag the item
as something that should be removed from stores.
However, what if there were a seasonal factor
affecting sales
that hadn't been accounted for in the AI tool's analysis?
Hallucinations like this one can lead to misguided decisions
if the user doesn't carefully review the AI tool's output.
Considering AI's limitations,
human oversight over AI generated output is crucial
to ensure that the information is accurate and ethical.
Effective management of AI in the workplace
requires teamwork from technical to non-technical roles
to ensure that AI's output and decision making processes
are aligned with values that benefit people.
Ultimately, an inclusive approach
that maintains human oversight over these tools
is the key to shaping a brighter future
where AI works for everyone. 


## Vint: Use AI for positive change

Hi, I'm Vint, vice president
and chief internet evangelist at Google.
Some people think of me as famous.
I don't. I think of me as lucky.
I had the good fortune of being the one of the people
who started the design of the internet in 1973.
And since that time,
my entire career has been strongly related
to internet and its evolution.
So people ask me, what is a chief internet evangelist
and why does the internet need an evangelist at all?
And the answer to that is that
only about two thirds of the world's population
are actually online and able to access
all the treasures and riches of the internet.
And so, the chief internet evangelist
is still running around the world,
encouraging people to build more internet
so everyone can have access.
I've been around in the AI space
for almost all of its existence
because the notion of artificial intelligence
goes all the way back to the 1960s.
So, let's talk a little bit about the way in which AI
can be used in crisis situations
like wildfires and things like that.
In nine different countries,
Google's services are being used, the SOS alerts,
to detect and to alert geographically about wildfires.
So, we are starting to see raw material
going into the artificial intelligence algorithms
to help us anticipate what a fire is going to do.
And that will help the forest fire response
and will certainly help get people out of buildings
if they are, in fact, at risk.
Another example comes from one of our sister organizations,
DeepMind, which trained a machine learning system
to learn how to fold proteins
that are generated by the interpretation of DNA.
And the reason that's so important is that
those molecules may turn out to be the key
to solving various kinds of genetic diseases.
I mean, I get really excited about stuff like that.
AI literacy is really about not the absolute details,
exactly how does this work?
Not everyone needs to know
how a car is constructed to use it.
We want people to have a conscious sense
of both the power and peril of artificial intelligence.
I think in the long run,
as we learn how to use these techniques better and better
and more reliably, that it will have a dramatic impact
on almost all walks of life.
It will enhance our ability to do research.
Every student might have a personal tutor, in fact.
Creative people, who are trying to create text
and film, video and imagery, will have a palette and a tool
far more capable than a paintbrush
in order to invent and create.
And so, in the same way that the worldwide web
has turned out to be such a huge platform
for creativity and innovation,
I think the AI world will induce a similar kind of effect. 


## Activity: Use AI to create a work email

### Activity Exemplar: Use AI to create a work email

Your Email prompt reflections template should include the following components:

1. The Prompt section contains the initial prompt and the Output section contains the initial output.

2. The Notes section presents a thoughtful evaluation of the conversational AI tool's output. It lists three ways that the output meets the needs of the task, such as its kind tone and its thoroughness. It also lists three ways the output should be adjusted, such as by making the email more concise.

3. The Observations section contains 3–5 sentences with observations about using a conversational AI tool to draft an email. For example, the reflection might suggest that it is easy to interact with the tool in a conversational way or that a potential workplace application is drafting other written content with the tool.



# AI FOR PROFESSIONALS

## Use AI as a collaborative tool

Ever wondered how to turn your busy workday
into an orderly operation?
Let's consider the incredible ways AI can enhance
your day-to-day processes.
When we use AI at work, embracing a people-first strategy
is essential.
AI enhances our unique human skills and simplifies
many of the tasks that we perform.
Essentially, AI augments our own capabilities.
In this context, AI augmentation refers to the process
of using AI to improve a work product,
whether by making it easier to do or higher in quality.
For example, think of your own job or a job
you might have held in the past.
Like mine, your job probably consists
of a variety of tasks and duties.
Some of the tasks might be simple, like manually responding
to routine questions over email.
Other tasks might be more complex,
like brainstorming new ideas with coworkers.
AI can help you with many of these things
by augmenting the work you do, helping you complete
the task quicker and more efficiently.
Another way AI can help you to do your work
is through automation.
AI automation refers to the process of using AI
to accomplish tasks without any action on the user's part.
For example, maybe a customer support representative
receives hundreds of emails every day
from customers asking for help.
They might spend a lot of time reading each email
and typing responses one at a time.
Using an AI tool, they could automatically sort
incoming emails by priority.
For emails with low priority,
they could use AI to draft replies.
With some guidance from other customer support agents
or training data containing past replies,
the AI could learn to quickly generate
quality email responses.
By automating this task, the representative could then focus
on high-priority messages, like ones reporting
complex issues that require personal attention.
Striking the right balance between augmentation
and automation takes time, practice,
and thoughtful consideration.
Successful businesses can set themselves apart
by applying a people-first approach to AI
and their products, services, and jobs.
Think of AI as a collaborative workspace
that thrives on diverse perspectives.
Consider a public relations professional who wants to use AI
to assist in the creation of press releases.
To make sure they get an optimal result,
they need to provide human oversight of the AI tool.
But it shouldn't stop there.
It's essential that they also collaborate with other members
of their team, such as managers who can coordinate resources
for the project, members of the editorial team to ensure
that the releases are representative of the brand's voice,
and guidance from the legal department to ensure
appropriate rules and regulations are followed.
Everyone has to cooperate to integrate AI successfully
and to make sure the tools' generated output
meets expectations.
Integrating AI at work must be an inclusive process.
It requires diverse perspectives from people
across different roles and departments
to achieve the best results.
It's critical to learn and adapt as AI
is introduced into the workplace.
By taking the time to understand AI
and how it can provide benefits in your work,
you can effectively contribute to the discussion. 


## Aleck: Make daily tasks easier with AI

Hi, my name is Aleck
and I'm an engineering program manager here at Google
and I'm on the central knowledge management team.
The aim of this department
is to ensure that knowledge is not stale,
that Googlers in particular are not reading documents
or working with tools that are out of date,
but just to ensure
that, you know, the information they're exposed to
is current, up to date,
and truly reflects on what's going on internally.
I definitely have a very non-traditional path.
Studied architecture in college.
I was working in architecture field for about five years.
I think architecture helped me get better
at establishing frameworks, applying frameworks,
and it's something that I can use now
with my job as a program manager at Google
to just making sure that things are set up appropriately.
And AI helps with that a lot, too,
to help me analyze different things
to ensure that projects can be successful.
First thing I used it for
was to better understand AI. (chuckles)
I used AI to learn about AI (chuckles)
and asked the AI for recommended material to read as well.
That was very useful.
The advice I would have for people
that want to use AI tools for the first time
is don't be afraid to use it for something small
and then, you know, work your way up.
Try to find a task that might be hard for you
or maybe somewhat stressful
or you're not really looking forward to it
and see how you can leverage it.
One example of how I use AI tools
to make my life more easier, especially with work,
is starting off a document.
That's like the hardest thing for me.
Just getting the template started,
having specific sections and headings in there,
leveraging AI is very useful and helpful
and kind of helps me create a more concise document as well.
I use AI for ways to make my work more efficient,
whether it's me taking notes,
email summarization, organizing emails,
providing key points on documents, planning for the week.
During every meeting, I create transcripts for meetings,
and then I then use AI
to help me create immediate action items,
summarize the meeting,
and provide me key takeaways from the meeting.
Saves me an hour to an hour and a half of my time.
And when things are efficient and they move well,
it makes work easier,
it makes it more fulfilling,
and that's something that is amazing
and something that is very, very powerful. 



# WRAP-UP MODULE 1

AI isn't just about adopting the latest tech.
The goal should be to thoughtfully incorporate AI
in a way that puts people first and adds value to your work.
In this section, we discovered how AI works,
including the fundamentals of AI and machine learning.
We investigated the capabilities and limits of AI.
We also examined how AI can enhance your work
and help you become more efficient.
The AI field is constantly changing.
New advancements are made every day,
and the technology is continuously improving.
I hope this experience serves as an exciting introduction
into new AI powered possibilities.
To continue learning,
I encourage you to explore how to transform the way you work
with AI as a part of Google AI Essentials.
