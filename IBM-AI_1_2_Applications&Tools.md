# TOOLS FOR TEXT GENERATION

Welcome to tools for text generation.
After watching this video,
you'll be able describe the basics of text generation through generative AI.
Explain the key capabilities of common models and tools for text generation.
At the core of the text generation capabilities of generative AI
are large language models, or LLMs.
Based on patterns and structures learned during training,
LLMs interpret context, grammar, and semantics to generate coherent and
contextually appropriate text.
Drawing statistical relationships between words and
phrases allows LLMs to adapt creative writing styles for any given context.
LLMs are the basis for many text generation models.
Two such examples are generative pre-trained transformer or GPT and PaLM.
These models have evolved into multimodal models offering multiple capabilities.
Lets learn about the capabilities of these models through two popular ChatGPT
and Bard.
ChatGPT is based on GPT as the large language model and
uses advanced natural language processing, or NLP.
While originally Chat GPT only took text prompts as input to generate new contents,
with the newer versions it can take both image and text inputs.
ChatGPT offers diverse capabilities for text generation.
It is capable of smooth and context-based conversations.
Let's start a conversation with ChatGPT to learn a concept,
input a prompt that says I've heard about generative AI and want to learn more.
ChatGPT responds with some basic information based on the context.
When you take the conversation forward to refine the research by asking,
how can I use generative AI to improve my storytelling skills?
As a prompt, ChatGPT provides the response based on the context and
question provided by you.
Feel free to experiment and guide the conversation further.
ChatGPT will build an informative and interesting conversational flow.
It can also help you with varied creative tasks.
Lets enter the prompt, help me to create slides to demonstrate the features of
a learning platform, and ChatGPT comes with suggestions about the title,
content and visuals for specific slides.
Although ChatGPT is most proficient in English, it can understand and
respond to several other languages.
Lets prompt it to write hello in French and Spanish, and
it generates the desired output.
ChatGPT can also be a useful tool to assist you in learning a new language or
any subject for that matter.
Another popular text generation tool is Google Bard.
It is based on Googles advanced language models PaLM, short for
pathways language model.
PaLM is a combination of transformer model and Google's pathways AI platform.
Path AI is based on pathways, which are specialized modules responsible for
a particular task, such as NLP or machine translation.
In addition to the massive training dataset of text and code,
it also pulls information from sources on the Internet to respond to prompts.
Try experimenting with different prompts to explore the capabilities of Bard.
Let's try bard with a prompt to get a summary of the latest news on a topic,
such as provide a summary of the latest news on the war in Ukraine.
It provides you with multiple drafts as the response,
you can select one of these or regenerate.
Next, lets try bar to generate ideas or solve a problem.
Lets prompt it to provide a strategy for a digital marketing campaign for
promoting a fashion brand.
It provides a step by step approach to the marketing campaign.
ChatGPT and Bard offer capabilities for other valuable use cases.
For example, they can help you with basic mathematics, statistics, and
problem solving through these subjects.
They are also proficient in financial analysis, investment research,
budgeting and more.
Furthermore, ChatGPT and Bard can generate code and
perform code-related tasks across various programming languages and frameworks.
Having interacted with both ChatGPT and Bard, you'll notice that ChatGPT is more
effective in generating dynamic responses and maintaining conversational flow.
While Bard may be a better choice for researching the latest news or
information on a topic,
as it has access to web sources through through Google Search and Google Scholar.
Its important to realize that generative AI models including GPT and
PaLM are evolving, so their capabilities and features may change.
Apart from ChatGPT and Bard, there are other text generators as well.
Jasper, for example,
generates high quality marketing content of any length tailored to a brands voice.
Rytr is a valuable tool for creating high-quality content for
blogs, emails, SEO metadata, and ads on social media.
Also, copy.ai is great for creating content for social media marketing and
product descriptions.
Another tool, Writesonic, offers specific templates for
different types of text such as articles in blogs, ads, and marketing.
There are also tools available for specific use cases.
For example, tools like Resoomer can generate a summary of a text by extracting
key ideas or concepts.
Next, tools like uClassify are used for classification to assign one or
more categories to a snippet of text.
Tools for sentiment analysis understand and
generate text that reflects the underlying emotions expressed in human language,
examples include Brand24 and Repustate.
For multilingual language translation, you can use language Weaver and Yandex.
It is important to note that many of the open source generative AI
tools collect and review the data shared with them to improve their systems.
This is an important consideration for interacting with these tools to avoid
sharing any confidential or sensitive information.
So, do we have open-source privacy-preserving alternatives?
The answer is yes.
GPT4All, for example, can be installed on your machines to run as a privacy aware
chatbot without Internet or a graphics processing unit.
Further, chatbots like H2O.ai and
PrivateGPT are designed to protect user privacy by running
on local machines without any Internet connection using the power of LLMs.
Not only that, you can customize these tools for use within a specific
organization by linking them to your organization's documents and databases.
Generative AI based text generators offer several benefits.
These tools are good learning aids as they provide step by step explanations.
They can generate different forms of text quickly, enabling efficiency for
writers and creators.
These tools enhance creativity and inspire new ideas by enabling engaging and
interactive conversations, they're useful as virtual assistants and chatbots.
By automating repetitive writing tasks, they can increase productivity for
organizations, with multilingual support, they enable communication and
content localization for global audiences.
In this video, you learned that LLMs interpret context, grammar, and
semantics to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.
LLMs are the basis for many text generation tools.
Two popular text generation tools are OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Bard.
ChatGPT is based on GPT and Bard is based on PaLM.
Both ChatGPT and Bard can generate different kinds of text, translate
languages, and answer your questions in an interactive and informative way.
Some of the other tools we talked about include Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic.
Open-source privacy-preserving text generators include GPT4All,
H2O.ai, and PrivateGPT.

can generate new images
and customize real and generated images
to give you the desired output.
For example, you may want to generate
an image of a child with a book in her hand.
Further, you may want to change the color
of the book cover in the generated image.
Let's generate a new image using
a free AI image generator, Freepik.
You need to enter a text prompt
describing the image you want to create.
Let's say you enter the following prompt,
a boat sailing on a calm lake at sunset,
surrounded by lush greenery and a serene sky.
Remember, how you describe
your image and the words you include in
the prompt determine the accuracy
and quality of the image that gets generated.
Let's select the style and generate the image.
Here, we have multiple images generated.
You can select and download an image,
or you may want to generate
other images by modifying the prompt.
Let's look at some more possibilities
of image generation models.
Image to image translation
refers to transforming an image from
one domain to another while
preserving the original matter and style.
For example, converting sketches to realistic images,
converting satellite images to maps,
converting security camera images
to higher resolution images,
and enhancing detail and medical imaging.
Style transfer and fusion involve extracting
the style from one image and applying it to another,
creating hybrid or fusion images,
for example, converting a painting to a photograph.
Inpainting refers to reconstructing
missing or damaged parts of an image to make it complete.
You can use this for art restoration, forensics,
removing unwanted objects and images
while preserving continuity and context,
and blending virtual objects into
real world scenes and augmented reality.
Outpainting involves extending the original image by
generating new parts to it that
are like extensions of the original.
This can be used for generating larger images,
enhancing resolution, and creating panoramic views.
The image generation and modifications capabilities of
generative models and tools have
evolved with the evolution of models that power them.
OpenAI's DALL-E is based on the GPT model.

to image diffusion model.
Diffusion models are generative models
that can create high resolution images.
Stable Diffusion is primarily used to
generate images based on text prompts.
Though it can also be used for image to
image translation inpainting and outpainting.
NVIDIA StyleGAN model separates
the modeling of image content and image style,
enabling precise control over style for
manipulating specific features like
pose or facial expression.
StyleGAN has evolved to generate
higher resolution images with more realistic details.
You can explore generative AIs text to

trained on vast datasets of human speech.
This allows them to break down and
efficiently replicate vocal characteristics,
such as pronunciation, speed, emotion, and intonation.
As a result, generative AI TTS tools
create more accurate natural sounding speech,
which is especially helpful to
those who struggle with visual impairment,
language barriers, and other reading disabilities.
On the fun side, these tools
can help you listen to essays,
feedback, and notes,
which might be easier than reading them.
They can also help you communicate better.
What if you wish to narrate
your presentation in a standout manner?
You could log into LOVO,
Synthesia, Murf.ai,
or Listenr, and choose from vast libraries
of AI voices, languages, or emotions.
You could even create a unique voice or clone your voice.
Some tools will also let you edit
your vocal tracks pronunciation, tone,
and speed to create a
professionally sounding final product.
What about music?
Let's say one sunny afternoon,
the amateur musician in you is feeling motivated.
You could try Meta's AudioCraft,
the generative AI tool pretrained on sound effects in
20,000 hours of Meta-owned or licensed music.
There's also Shutterstock's Amper music, AIVA,
Soundful, Google's Magenta,
and the GPT-4-powered WavTool.
These tools let you choose from extensive music banks,
different music genres,
instrumental styles, and melodies.
All you need to do is enter a text prompt.
Based on your request,
the tool will write short melodies or riffs,
suggest or add instruments,
compose a new song,
or create a soundtrack for
your next YouTube or Instagram video.
Generative AI can also help you mix, master,
and publish your final musical output
on popular streaming platforms.
You can even use audio enhancing tools.
These are pretrained to identify specific sounds and can
add fun sounds to your audio or remove unwanted ones.
For example, Descript can
help you remove background noise,
enhance low quality recordings,
and add the desired sound effects.
Audo AI cleans your files of unwanted noise.
Many music generation tools also
possess audio editing and enhancement capabilities.
However, some projects need
more than eclectic sound effects.
In 2022, Runway AI used
generative AI capabilities to
produce the Oscar winning movie,
Everything Everywhere all at once.
Even if you're not making big cinema,
you can use generative AI video tools
in your everyday life.
Let's say you're making
a documentary on the lack of trees in your city.
You could log into Runway's Gen-1 tool,
which transforms existing video clips
into different styles or use
Runway's Gen-2 tool to create
a video using text image or video inputs.
Alternatively, you can use
the EaseUS video toolkit or the Synthesia app.
These tools will allow you to upload photos.
If you don't have any, use
text prompts to generate the images you need.
Additionally, you can use
these tools to record a narration,
enhance your audio, convert your video file format,
and publish your video.

# TOOLS FOR CODE GENERATION

Welcome to tools for code generation.
After watching this video,
you'll be able to describe
the basic capabilities of
generative AI for code generation,
discuss the strengths and limitations of
text generating tools for code generation,
and explain the key capabilities of
common models and tools for code generation.
Generative AI models and tools for
code generation can generate
code based on natural language input.
Based on deep learning and
natural language processing or NLP,
these models comprehend the context
and produce contextually appropriate code.
Code generators can generate
a new code snippet or a program from a text prompt.
They can predict lines of code
to complete a partial code snippet.
They can also produce optimized
versions of existing code.
Further, these code generators can convert
code from one programming language to another.
They can also generate summaries and
comments for code to improve documentation.
Code generators can also
recommend a complete programming solution.
Describe a problem you're trying to solve and
code generators will suggest algorithms,
data structures, and the right programming approaches.
Let's explore the capabilities of
GPT for code generation.
OpenAI's GPT excels in
human-like text generation and
demonstrates impressive capabilities in code creation.
Here's an example of generating
simple Python code through ChatGPT,
a tool based on GPT.
When you enter a text prompt,
write a Python code to
generate a message to greet a person.
ChatGPT generates the Python code for it.
Interestingly, it also provides
guidelines about how to run this code.
For generating code, it's
important that you provide a clear prompt,
specify the programming language,
and provide other relevant requirements and constraints.
To demonstrate how GPT helps debug code,
enter an incorrect code as a text prompt in ChatGPT.
An incorrect code and text are prompted to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT provides the correct code
and explanations of the corrections made.
GPT also enables translating
code from one programming language to another.
It can also generate code documentation
and comments to improve readability.
GPT-based models and tools have
evolved to generate longer and more accurate codes.
This enables using these models and tools for
coding to develop apps, websites, and plugins.
Furthermore, the evolution of GPT
makes it possible to generate code for images.
For example, you can input the image of
a course outline to generate
