## Tris: My favorite ways to use AI

I'm Tris.
I'm a product management director at Google DeepMind,
which means I work on Cutting-Edge AI Research.
DeepMind is the team that has the mission
to disrupt what's possible with computers
and to do so in a responsible way.
Every day I come into work
and I try to figure out what it is that we can do
to make AI and our research just a little bit better,
to organize better, to make our team cohere better,
to make sure that we get products out better.
I think working in AI right now
is a bit like being around during the Renaissance
and watching science unfold
and completely reshape what was possible for humanity.
I personally believe
that AI will be the most important invention
of our lifetimes.
I use AI in my work all the time to come up with new ideas,
to collaborate with my colleagues,
to change the way that I'm thinking,
and to test what I do.
But recently, one of the largest consulting firms in
America
actually released a study about using generative AI
to improve productivity of its workforce,
and they found that it improved
people's efficiency, quality, and accuracy.
I found that to be the case in my work as well.
It's an amazingly cool, iterative, creative process
that can improve your life.
I also use it for my personal life.
You say, "Oh, you know, my wife really loves
dogs, and cooking, and the outdoors,
and music, especially folk music."
And you say,
"What would be amazing birthday party ideas for her?"
And you can ask follow-up questions
and find really interesting ideas
that I honestly never would've come up with myself.
Get out there. Experiment.
You can learn this. You can do this.
Anybody can do this. Right?
You know, my kids can use generative AI tools effectively
and answer questions and explore interesting areas.
And I know that everybody watching this course can too. 


## Understand how AI tools work

There are all kinds of ways to leverage AI tools
and many of them are readily available to you.
Let's explore the different ways that AI tools
can be integrated into your work routine
and how they can streamline your workflows.
As you might recall, an AI tool is AI powered software
that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks.
In your role, you may come across generative AI tools
in a few different ways, as stand-alone AI tools,
as integrated AI features or as custom solutions.
A stand-alone AI tool describes AI-powered software
that's designed to be used on its own.
Stand-alone AI tools can be accessed online
or downloaded to a device with little or no technical setup.
For example, Speeko is an AI speech coach
designed to help you communicate with confidence.
Speeko uses AI to analyze your voice
and give you feedback
on how to improve your communication skills in any setting,
whether you're preparing for online meetings
or in-person presentations.
Suppose you're preparing for a job interview
and want to practice answering common interview questions.
With Speeko, you can record yourself responding
to these questions, and Speeko will give you feedback
on aspects, like clarity, pacing, and word choice,
helping you learn how to communicate more effectively
during the actual interview.
Speeko also gives you personalized exercises
to help you improve your skills.
As another example, let's say,
you want to create a new image for a design project
using a desktop app you already have.
Instead of searching for a stand-alone image generator,
the desktop app might have an integrated AI feature
that can help you get the job done.
An integrated AI feature refers to a built-in enhancement
to a particular piece of software.
For example, Neural Filters is an AI tool
that's built right into Adobe Photoshop.
It lets you edit images by blurring backgrounds,
adjusting colors, changing facial expressions,
and much more.
Stand-alone tools and integrated features
are two common ways to use AI,
but custom AI solutions are also an option.
A custom AI solution is an application
that's tailormade to solve a specific problem.
For instance, in 2022, Johns Hopkins Hospital
implemented an AI solution to help doctors detect sepsis,
a condition where the body
has an extreme response to an infection.
This AI solution allowed doctors to diagnose
and treat patients up to six hours sooner
than previously possible,
leading to improved patient outcomes.
AI models, like this, can be rewarding to build,
but they typically require dedicated resources
and buy-in from your organization to produce.
In this course, we'll focus mainly
on stand-alone generative AI tools
because they're readily available, often free to use,
and can easily fit in your workstream.
Before using AI tools, it's helpful to understand
the technologies that power them, AI models.
An AI model is a computer program trained on a set of data
to recognize patterns and perform specific tasks.
Think of the AI model as the engine
and the AI tool as the car.
The model provides the underlying capabilities
while the tools interface assists you in completing tasks.
Whether you're using a stand-alone tool,
an integrated feature, or a custom solution in your work,
remember that an AI tool is powered by an AI model.
Next up, we'll explore how to effectively engage
with AI tools to tackle a variety of tasks
and boost your productivity. 


## AI models and the training process

You’ve already explored how AI tools are powered by AI models. In this reading, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of how AI models are developed. You'll uncover the iterative process that AI designers and engineers use to train AI models from data, ensuring that AI tools work reliably. Learning more about the inner workings of AI tools will help you discuss them more accurately and confidently.

- AI tools and AI models

Terms like AI tools and AI models can be confusing because they sound similar but refer to different things. Recall that an AI tool is AI-powered software that can automate or assist users with a variety of tasks. An AI model is a computer program trained on sets of data to recognize patterns and perform specific tasks.

To illustrate this relationship, consider a car and its engine.

A car as a metaphor, where an AI tool is the car and an AI model is the engine.

The car with its user-friendly interface like a steering wheel and dashboard, represents the AI tool. This tool helps you get to your destination, which could be a completed task or a desired output. Just like car engineers design different features for various needs, AI designers and engineers build AI tools with functionalities specific to their purpose. But under the hood, so to speak, lies the AI model. This unseen engine processes the information you provide, like your input into a photo editing software, and allows the AI tool to function.

Similar to how we choose cars based on their purpose, like a sedan for everyday driving or a pickup truck for hauling heavy loads, AI tools are developed for a wide range of applications. There are AI tools for generating different creative texts, images, videos, or even writing computer code. And regardless of the specific function of the AI tool, it's the underlying AI model that does the heavy lifting, powering the tool's capabilities.

_Note: Some AI tools leverage multiple AI models, working together as a "family," to achieve more flexibility and perform a wider range of tasks. Each model within the family might be specialized for a specific subtask, ultimately contributing to the overall functionality of the AI tool. You'll explore these types of multimodal tools later in this course._

- The process of training AI models

AI designers and engineers develop AI models through a process called training. Here’s an example of the typical steps a designer might take in this process, in this case for building a model that predicts rainfall:

1. Define the problem to be solved: AI designers and engineers want to predict rain to help people stay dry when commuting to and from work. They start by considering AI’s capabilities and limitations before identifying an AI solution.

2. Collect relevant data to train the model: AI designers and engineers gather historical data of days when it rained and days when it didn't rain over the past 50 years.

3. Prepare the data for training: AI designers and engineers prepare the data by labeling important features, such as outdoor temperature, humidity, and air pressure, and then noting whether it rained. It's also common to separate the data into two distinct sets: a training set and a validation set to test with later.

4. Train the model: AI designers and engineers apply machine learning (ML) programs to their rain prediction model, which helps it recognize patterns in its training data that indicate the likelihood of rainfall. Those patterns might include high temperatures, low air pressure, and high humidity.

5. Evaluate the model: AI designers and engineers use the validation set they prepared earlier to assess their model's ability to predict rainfall accurately and reliably. Analyzing a model's performance can uncover potential issues impacting the model, such as insufficient or biased training data. If any issues exist, the AI designers and engineers may revisit an earlier step in this process to try a different approach. Once the model performs well with its validation set, the process continues to the next step.

6. Deploy the model: When the AI designers and engineers are satisfied with their model's performance, they deploy it in an AI tool—helping people in their city stay dry on their way to work!

Model training is an iterative process. AI designers and engineers can repeat each step as many times as necessary and make adjustments until they create the best model possible. 

But the process doesn't stop at deployment. Once users interact with a model in practical situations, the model might be exposed to new challenges. AI designers and engineers should continuously monitor and collect feedback on their models, ensuring their models continue to perform reliably and to identify areas for improvement. It's this iterative process of continual refinement that makes AI models precise and versatile, which ultimately leads to effective, reliable AI tools. When you understand how AI models are developed, you can make informed decisions about when and how to use an AI tool to accomplish your goals.



# INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY WITH GENERATIVE AI

## Transform your work with generative AI

Many jobs require creativity,
problem solving, and brainstorming,
which can be challenging or time-consuming.
Imagine you're tasked with writing a comprehensive report
on the latest industry trends impacting your company.
You're trying your best to write,
but you're not sure where to start
and are feeling overwhelmed with all the information.
Sound familiar? I've definitely been there too.
In situations like these,
generative AI tools can be incredibly useful.
They can help you conduct exploratory research,
create an outline, and offer insights
into the information you've explored.
We've explored various types of generative AI tools
and how they're capable of assisting with tasks like this.
Now, let's consider how to actually use these tools
and apply them to solve problems.
To use a generative AI tool,
you'll need to guide the tool with a prompt.
A prompt is text input that provides instructions
to the AI model on how to generate output.
Think of prompts as your way of communicating
with a generative AI tool.
You can edit and refine your prompts as many times as needed
to tell the tool exactly what you need it to do.
Suppose you're an IT professional tasked with creating
a how-to guide for a new software application.
You could prompt a text generator
to draft a step-by-step guide for installing new software.
For parts of your work that involve troubleshooting,
you could prompt the AI tool
to identify errors in this code,
to help you address any programming issues.
You can use the same AI tool to summarize user feedback
on the software application,
so you can address user feedback efficiently
while also ensuring that the application is user-friendly.
Or let's say you're starting a business selling backpacks.
Think of the time you can save
by prompting a generative AI tool
to list creative name ideas for an outdoor backpack brand.
You could then use the tool to help you attract investors
by prompting it to draft a comprehensive business plan
that focuses on backpack production.
And as your business grows,
you could use the same generative AI tools
to craft a job description for a sales manager
with online retail experience.
Using generative AI like this streamlines
your brainstorming and planning process,
allowing you to also focus on growing your business.
Whether you work in retail, technology,
manufacturing, sales, or any other field,
generative AI tools can be used to enhance
your creative problem solving skills
and transform the way you approach your work.
Now that we've explored a few ways
to use generative AI tools,
take a moment to think about your own job
and the industry that you work in.
How might you use generative AI
to help you accomplish tasks more quickly and efficiently? 


## Work with Gemini

Now let's practice creating effective prompts
that can guide an AI tool to generate content.
Imagine you want to use an AI tool
to help you apply for a new job.
I'll focus on simple prompts here,
and you'll discover prompt engineering best practices
later in the course.
To use Gemini, go to gemini.google.com.
Sign in with a Google account.
If you don't have a Google account,
you can create one for free by clicking create account.
Once you're signed into your Google account,
you can start providing Gemini with prompts.
Let's say the job that you want to apply for
is in social media.
Your prompt might be,
"Write a cover letter for a social media position."
Neat.
The response provides you
with a useful starting point or template
that you can customize
to make your cover letter really stand out.
After adding some finishing touches,
you send the letter off, and great news,
you receive an invitation to interview with the company.
You can continue to use Gemini
to help you prepare for the interview.
Your next prompt could be, "What are some interview tips
to help me prepare for a social media position?"
The output includes a variety of options to choose from.
They seem to be insightful
and tailored to the social media industry,
offering advice on topics
like what to do before and during your interview.
Fast forward a few years down the road.
You landed that social media job, grew within the company,
and you're now in charge of onboarding new hires.
You can turn to a tool like Gemini once more
with a prompt like this one.
"Suggest three innovative training activities
that new employees could participate in."
Wow, those suggestions
are really fun activities for new employees.
When using generative AI tools,
it's important to write clear and specific prompts.
The more you experiment with writing prompts,
the better you'll get at using AI tools
to accomplish your goals. 


## Manvinder: Ways I use AI in my work

Hi, I'm Manvinder.
I'm a director of product management in
the AI team at Google.
My job involves talking to developers, talking to startups,
talking to companies that are using our AI technologies,
understand their feedback,
and then incorporate that into the tools that we offer
to them to build applications using our AI tech.
So one of the most amazing things about generative AI is it
can be used as a collaborative tool
by almost everybody in your day-to-day tasks.
You know, anything from, you know, writing memos,
writing emails, creating slides,
working on spreadsheets, doing research.
It's just a great tool for you to collaborate with.
Another great use case for AI is for it
to be your creative brainstorming partner.
For example, I was recently working with our marketing team
and we were brainstorming strategies
for marketing a particular product,
and I used AI to just generate ideas.
It gave us a lot of new ideas
that maybe just me alone would not have thought of.
I'm using AI when I'm creating graphics in slides,
I'm using them to do long form writing.
For example, if you're writing a memo or an email
or a blog post, AI just makes it easier to get started,
helps you overcome writer's block.
I'm using AI to do visualizations in spreadsheets,
and of course, when I'm beginning research on a new topic,
I like to use AI to just give me a head start.
It is helping me be more efficient.
It is helping me do things in a better way.
It is also helping me do new things.
For example, about a year ago,
me and my wife were redesigning our kitchen
and we decided to try out Stable Diffusion,
which is an open source image generation model
to create different styles of the kitchen
that we wanted, combining different cabinet
styles and island styles.
We really saw firsthand how we could use the power
of generative AI to to solve common challenges
that we face in our everyday lives.
AI can often help you become even better at the
skills that you might possess.
For example, if you often do a lot of long form writing,
AI can help you become more efficient by giving you a head
start and overcoming writer's block, it can add more ideas
to, you know, the memos you're writing,
the emails you're writing, the blogs you're writing.
I'm excited about the applications of AI in diverse fields.
I'm also excited about the massive challenges
that we can solve as a community, as an ecosystem.
It will lead to productivity improvements, it'll lead
to new ways of doing things, the potential of impact
of AI is immense.

# THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AI

## Leverage the human-in-the-loop approach to AI

Although AI is a useful tool to help you accomplish tasks,
it requires human involvement.
No AI tool has the depth of experience, practical knowledge,
and interactive skills that we do.
Maintaining human oversight over AI is critical.
An effective strategy for doing so
is a human-in-the-loop approach,
which uses a combination of machine and human intelligence
to train, use, verify, and refine AI models.
Let's try this strategy.
Consider this scenario.
An insurance company uses a custom AI solution
to answer customer inquiries.
When a customer sends a question
to the company using their contact form,
AI drafts an email response based on specific words
and phrases in the message.
Then a customer service agent reviews the customer inquiry
and revises the email responses necessary
before approving and then sending the message.
Later, the development team can update the AI model
based on the agent's feedback.
Now, consider a business owner
that's using a standalone AI tool
to draft a new brand slogan.
They prompt the tool with specific keywords
and phrases that they'd like to feature in the slogan,
and the tool generates a list of ideas.
As the business owner reviews the output,
they find a catchy option that really stands out.
However, it needs a little refinement
to get the phrasing just right.
So the business owner prompts the AI tool
with a few extra details, and voila,
they put together a catchy new slogan for their business.
Oversight is essential to ensure quality
and accuracy when using AI tools.
A human-in-the-loop approach blends the efficiency
of AI tools with human insight
that's critical for practicing responsible AI.
Responsible AI is the principle of developing
and using AI ethically with the intent of benefiting people
and society while avoiding harm.
It's important for businesses, customers,
and employees alike to ensure that they use AI responsibly.
One aspect of responsible AI involves managing
the limitations of AI models such as knowledge cutoff.
Knowledge cutoff is the concept that an AI model
is trained at a specific point in time
so it doesn't have any knowledge of events
or information after that date.
For example, imagine you're a financial analyst
and you need to prompt an AI tool
to analyze yesterday's stock market fluctuations.
If the tool's last training date was in 2022,
it wouldn't be able to provide you
with the information you asked for
because it doesn't know about events
or information beyond its last training date.
In situations like these, well-designed AI tools
should recognize their limitations and respond accordingly.
However, there are situations when a tool might try
to generate a response despite its knowledge cutoff,
leading to a hallucination.
Hallucinations are AI outputs that are not true.
Hallucinations can be problematic
because they can lead to misinformation, misinterpretation,
or inappropriate responses
that might damage a company's reputation
or result in customer dissatisfaction.
For example, picture working at a retail company
using an AI tool to forecast
how much product inventory to order.
If the AI tool produces inaccurate,
outdated, or misinterpreted information,
those hallucinations could lead the company
to order the wrong amount of inventory
causing supply issues for customers.
While hallucinations can pose challenges,
they can also be beneficial to your creative process.
Suppose you use an AI image generator
to help you design concept art
for a fantasy-themed video game.
You prompt the AI tool to create an image
of a beautiful castle floating in the sky,
and it outputs a unique, fun image,
which also happens to be a hallucination.
In this example, you produced a hallucination intentionally.
However, hallucinations can be misleading
when used in the wrong context.
When using AI tools,
it's important to apply a human-in-the-loop approach.
By reviewing and evaluating AI-generated content,
you can help mitigate
the potential effects of hallucinations.
This approach helps ensure
that AI-generated outputs are not only innovative,
but also accurate, relevant, and ethical,
enhancing outcomes for businesses,
customers, and society as a whole. 


## Kathy: Explore how people improve AI models

Hi, I'm Kathy.
I'm a product manager on the Google Labs team,
and I work on CodeAI.
CodeAI is ways to generate programming languages in code
so that software developers can use CodeAI
to help them write applications.
So I'm from Alaska and we were the first family
on the block to get internet.
I'm one of five kids, so mom had a signup sheet.
So everybody in the family wanted
to use the computer so much
that we all just got 30-minute increments.
I remember when I first opened up a browser
and went to a webpage,
I saw other comments on it from people
who were around the world,
and I had no idea that you could talk to people that quickly
who are on the other side of the planet,
and it just blew my mind.
When I look at AI,
and especially with the advancement of LLMs
and applying that to all of the developer tools
that we have today, I have that same feeling
of just being incredibly in awe
of what is happening and what we're making,
what my colleagues and I are making.
When you're thinking about AI
and you're thinking about large language models
or deep learning or whatever application
of AI you're dealing with, at the heart of whatever
that model is is a person who is training it,
who's evaluating it, who is applying more data to it.
Human-in-the-loop is doing things like writing a prompt
for the AI to give you a question,
and then the AI gives you a question and you further refine.
For me, it helps me write code.
So if it doesn't get the code answer correct,
I'll further prompt it to get it to give me a function
that I actually really like.
So the way I look at human-in-the-loop is a way
to refine the AI's answers.
There's a huge potential for AI to do good in the world,
and the reason why is because AI is a tool
that humans created to help us connect
with each other more and help us be more human. 


## Determine if generative AI is right for the task

As you consider how to use generative AI in your own work,
it's important to understand what AI can and can't do.
One way to assess whether to apply generative AI
to a task is to consider these guiding questions.
First, is the task generative?
Then, can the task be iterated on
to achieve the best outcome?
And finally, are there resources
to provide adequate human oversight?
Let's use a scenario to demonstrate
how you might answer these questions
and decide whether to use a generative AI tool.
Imagine you're preparing for the grand opening
of your new restaurant.
You consider using an AI tool to create a promotional ad
for the event, but you need some assistance
developing the images.
You start by asking, is the task generative?
Yes.
Recall that generative AI is a type of AI
that can generate new content such as text,
images, or other media.
So generative AI can help you create promotional materials
like text or images to advertise your new restaurant.
Next, can the task be iterated on
to achieve the best outcome?
In other words, can you refine your prompt
to improve your AI generated output?
This is another yes.
Generative AI tools allow you to edit
and refine your prompts as many times as you need
to achieve the desired results.
In this case, say your restaurant serves Italian food
and the AI tool generates an ad with a picture
of a spaghetti dish.
After thinking about the output,
you decide it'd be more appealing
to feature your restaurant's freshly baked pizza coming out
of your wood-fired oven.
You iterate and refine your prompt
until you receive the best results.
And finally, are there resources
to provide adequate human oversight?
Once again, the answer here is yes.
Either you, as the restaurant's owner,
or one of your employees will need
to review the AI generated ads
before sharing them with the public.
Remember that a human in the loop approach should always be
taken when using AI tools.
So make sure that you
or someone on your team is able to review
and edit the output.
By asking yourself these guiding questions,
you can decide whether
to use generative AI tools on a specific task.
If you answered yes to all of the questions,
then using a generative AI might be the right fit.
But what happens if you answer no to one
or more of the questions?
For example, suppose you need to negotiate
with local suppliers to get fair prices
for the ingredients you want to use at your restaurant.
When it comes to the question, is the task generative?
The answer in this situation is no.
A task like this is not generative
because it requires communication
and relationship building,
skills that require a human touch.
As you continue to experiment with using AI at work,
try asking yourself these guiding questions
to decide whether generative AI could help you complete some
of your tasks.
