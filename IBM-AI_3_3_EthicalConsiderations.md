Imagine yourself racing through
the day in the fast paced world of HR.
Your inbox is flooded with
potentially good resumes and
AI generated recommendations.
But is there a way to ensure that
these recommendations are fair and accurate?
Generative AI can automate
tasks like creating resumes tailored to
the job description and reviewing them based
on specific skills needed and filtering them out.
The AI assistants conduct the preliminary round of
interviews so that the HR executives
can focus on more strategic duties.
However, bias and training data
can lead to discriminatory filtering,
favoring resumes for
particular skills with specific keywords,
gender and race used by a certain demographic.
HR must ensure diverse datasets and
AI augmented decisions in
the final selection process to mitigate this.
HR ethics and AI is
an evolving field with many complex scenarios,
ranging from bias free recruitment to
fair performance reviews to
responsible use of employee data.
Effective guard rails on the source of data
and the data used for training the model go a

the generative AI models used for HR practices.
Now, let's consider the
transparency and explainability aspects.
Generative AI can analyze
vast amounts of data for different use cases,
including identifying performance trends and
suggesting personalized coaching or training programs.
This data driven approach can offer valuable insights.
However, solely relying on AI metrics
might overlook qualitative aspects of performance.
What's the middle path here?
HR must ensure that the evaluation
is comprehensive and considers context,
employee input, and AI generated data.
Consider using generative AI models
that explain the decisions taken.
HR should also be transparent and clearly
communicate how AI systems are leveraged in HR processes.
They should be able to explain to candidates and
team members how AI models make various decisions.
For example, how are resumes
vetted or promotion decisions made?
Black Box approaches where
the internal workings of
the AI system are not transparent
or understandable can cause issues and
foster mistrust between the HR staff and employees.
Now imagine the massive volumes
of employee data including
personal data that are needed for
generative AI systems, being at risk.
How can you protect this data?
HR is responsible for managing
this data to protect employees privacy and
comply with privacy rules like
the general data protection regulation, or GDPR.
HR must also ensure
strong data security procedures
are in place to stop any breaches.
Furthermore, employees also have
a right to know how their information is utilized.
Therefore, their consent and
clear data privacy practices are essential.
While you explore the opportunity
of AI powered assistance,
remember that humans are still
the heart and soul of the HR world.
While AI can automate work,
human supervision and planning is the foundation.
How can these two collaborate effectively,
AI powered chatbots can respond to
frequently requested questions and schedule interviews.
Generative AI can also tailor employee messaging,
collect appropriate learning material,
and create individualized career development plans.
However, over reliance on AI communication
might appear impersonal and create a sense of detachment.
HR must maintain personal contact throughout the process,
particularly during critical stages
such as interview confirmation or rejection.
HR should also maintain
regular interactions and
feedback sessions with employees,
open communication channels,
and opportunities for employees
to express their issues directly.
Additionally, HR professionals must monitor AI systems,
intervene when needed, and
accept responsibility for their outcomes.
However, AI can supplement HR processes,
not completely replace HR tasks.
You have now reached the end of this video. Let's recap.
In this video, you
learned that bias and training data can
lead to discriminatory filtering
in AI generated recommendations,
making the use of diverse datasets and
human oversight necessary in the final selection process.
You also learned that the field of HR ethics and
AI involves ensuring
fair recruitment, performance reviews,
and responsible data usage,
which can be achieved through effective guard rails on
data sources and transparency in AI decisions.
Additionally, you learned the importance of balancing
data driven insights from AI
with qualitative performance evaluations,
and the need for HR to communicate
clearly how AI systems are utilized to foster trust.
Furthermore, you learned about
the necessity of strong data security measures,

## Responsible Use of Generative AI in HR

Welcome to responsible use of Generative AI in HR.
After watching this video,
you will be able to analyze how to leverage generative AI and HR responsibly.
You will identify the key considerations for
responsibly using generative AI in HR functions.
You will also identify the relevance of human insight and
judgment in generative AI driven human resources.
Generative AI offers exceptional and
unmatched benefits that can transform any organization.
But, its implementation needs to be done wisely,
so as not to eliminate the human touch with the employees.
Now, picture this, you an HR professional,
wish to craft a job description that attracts various talent pools.
How would you implement AI to do it?
Generative AI can be trained to identify keywords and craft descriptions tailored
to resonate with an ideal candidate based on successful hires from the past.
However, to ensure fairness and eliminate bias,
the training data needs to be audited and reviewed by humans.
It goes without saying that it is always best practice for
HR to provide feedback to the candidates who are not selected.
Additionally, privacy must be maintained by anonymizing personal
data wherever possible to protect employee privacy.
Now, lets talk about screening.
Generative AI can sift through resumes and
select the best candidates based on predetermined criteria.
This enables HR professionals to redirect their energy to conducting in depth
interviews with top tier prospects.
However, one should not just rely on matching the keywords to screen
candidates.
Still, as an HR professional, one should also create processes that examine
the application of relevant experience and talents.
Now, let's take a step further toward the onboarding process.
It's fun to interact with a chatbot,
which can significantly reduce the human effort required during onboarding.
But, the human touch should not be lost altogether.
An over reliance on AI can also block new hires from building rapport with their
colleagues.
It is important to implement safety guardrails such as access controls,
to ensure the secure use of AI during onboarding.
Generative AI can analyze performance data and provide recommendations for
areas of improvement as well as personalized training programs.
The analysis, backed by a metric evaluation,
does help a manager offer targeted feedback.
But, is statistical data the only basis for performance evaluations?
It is HRs responsibility to balance AI generated performance analysis with
manager observations and self assessments made by employees.
They should consider creating forums where employees can have appraisal discussions
and supervisor performance analysis, which can sometimes be sentiment driven.
Let's talk about AI powered learning platforms.
They are game changers, able to create personalized development plans based on
an individual's skills, career trajectories, goals and performance data.
However, the human element is crucial in this area as well.
The true feeling of mentorship often depends on having a designated mentor
to whom you can look for guidance and mentorship.
But, what if your employee does not believe you have made the correct
decision?
This is why trust building is crucial.
HR personnel must explain to the employee how generative AI
has been trained to perform certain decision making processes.
Transparency often fosters a sense of trust and
acceptance within the organization.
Finally, lets shift gears to move on to data security.
HR must ensure that the employee data that the AI is using remains free of
any data breaches.
Clear data policies should be put together to outline how data is collected, used and
stored.
It is the right of an employee to inquire if their data is being stored
responsibly or not.
Regardless of generative AI's role, HR professionals must own and be accountable
for the content generated and decisions made using the generated output.
Accountability in generative AI demands that HR professionals recognize their
ownership and consider the ethical and legal considerations surrounding its use.

## Custom Generative AI Models for Your Organization

Welcome to custom generative
AI models for your organization.
After watching this video,
you'll be able to explain how
training large language models or
LLMs on proprietary data
enhances domain-specific knowledge.
You'll also be able to describe the process of building
the LLM training pipeline and list
the benefits of training LLMs on proprietary data.
Additionally, you'll be able to explain
considerations for training LLMs on proprietary data.
Consider an organization that manages
a diverse workforce at multiple locations.
Its human resource or
HR department includes proprietary HR data,
such as employee performance reviews,
internal communications, and training records.
The organization aims to improve its HR processes,
such as employee onboarding,
performance evaluations, and personalized training plans.
To do so, they consider training LLMs on
proprietary data to enable data confidentiality,
enhance data security pipelines,
provide relevant content for
pertaining company policies and culture,
and fine-tune specific use cases
such as resume screening.
These parameters help organizations
achieve high levels of efficiency.
For example, organizations have
their own resume screening strategies for similar roles,
which differ from one role to another.
However, fine-tuning LLMs based on
business requirements helps HR
customize the HR-related processes.
Let's dive deep into understanding how to build
an LLM training pipeline in an organization.
The LLM training pipeline
starts with data collection and its curation.
Then the data gets pre-processed,
followed by model selection.
Finally, the model is
fine-tuned and evaluated with multiple iterations.
Let's review each of them in detail.
LLM collects relevant proprietary text data
from various resources such as internal documents,
emails, chat logs,
performance reviews, and policies.
To curate the data,
LLM removes personal information
and retains sensitive information.
However, using anonymous data
enables it to remain in compliance with privacy laws.
Next, LLM removes noise,
special characters, and irrelevant content
to pre-process these data.
Further, the data analyst selects
either a new or a pre-trained LLM model.
Then they fine-tune
the data model using proprietary data.
Lastly, the data analyst evaluates and reviews
the LLM model and its capabilities
to leverage seamless usage for HR professionals.
Retrieval augmented generation or
RAG is a technology useful
for enabling an LLM to fetch
relevant data from an organization-specific database.
RAG has capabilities for
fine-tuning data models to
train LLMs on the specific data.
RAG excels as an LLM to provide
the latest information by
avoiding biases that hinder the fine-tuning.
However, RAG requires good access
to external knowledge sources to run it faster.
So how does training LLMs on
proprietary data benefit organizations?
Training LLMs on proprietary data enhances
domain-specific knowledge and enables
LLMs to understand an organization's unique culture.
It also helps combat bias through tailored training.
This means that organizations can curate
datasets that reflect their diverse workforces.
Hence, it helps to identify
and mitigate potential biases within
LLMs and promotes fairness
and inclusivity in organizations.
Training LLMs on proprietary data
also helps personalize employee experiences,
such as the onboarding journey.
It also analyzes internal communication channels to
identify employee concerns and suggest training programs.
It also unlocks hidden insights from internal data.
HR departments often possess
valuable data from performance reviews,
internal surveys, and employee feedback.
Training LLMs on this data
can extract useful insights and
hidden patterns to identify
skill gaps and recommend employee learning materials.
Lastly, LLMs help HR
streamline repetitive tasks such as resume screening,
conducting screening interviews, and
generating personalized job descriptions.
This allows HR to focus on other strategic tasks,
including talent management and employee relations.
Until now, you've learned about the benefits of
training LLMs on proprietary data.
However, several considerations must be addressed to
ensure the successful implementation
of LLM on proprietary data.
These considerations are data security and privacy,
mitigating bias in training data,
maintaining transparency,
and maintaining a culture of continuous learning.
Let's review each of these considerations.
The first important consideration
is data security and privacy.
While implementing LLMs and training data,
organizations should take robust measures by building
anonymous data techniques and
adhering to data privacy regulations.
The next consideration is
mitigating bias in training data.
However, even with unbiased datasets,
subtle biases may exist.
Therefore, HR must conduct
thorough data audits to identify
and minimize those biases in the training data.
HR professionals should properly explain the data and
maintain transparency for
the LLM-generated recommendations to build trust.
Lastly, organizations should maintain a culture of
continuous learning to stay updated with
the latest developments in LLM training and its use.
To achieve this, they can collaborate with AI experts,
attend LLM training-related conferences,
and actively monitor LLM's performance.
Now, you've reached the end of this video. Let's recap.
In this video, you've learned how LLMs
help HR professionals make data-driven decisions.
To build an LLM training pipeline,
data analysts curate and pre-process data,
select and fine-tune a model,
and then evaluate and refine it using the LLM.
RAG is a technology useful for enabling
an LLM to fetch relevant data
from an organization-specific database.
Training LLMs on proprietary data has several benefits.
It helps enhance domain-specific knowledge,
combat bias through tailored training,
personalize employee experiences,
unlock hidden insights from internal data,
and streamline repetitive tasks.
However, while implementing LLMs on proprietary data,
certain considerations regarding data security,
privacy, and bias mitigation,
and maintaining data transparency should
be followed to leverage the full potential of LLMs.
You should avoid overreliance on
AI-generated data and maintain
a culture of continuous learning.
