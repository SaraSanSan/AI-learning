## AI Agents for Human Resources

Welcome to AI Agents for Human Resources.
After watching this video,
you will be able to explain
the use cases and benefits of using
AI agents or virtual assistants in human resources or HR.
Additionally, you will explore examples of
autonomous AI agents designed
specifically for HR functions.
Furthermore, you will be able to identify
how AI agents act as allies to professionals,
emphasizing the human-in-the loop approach.
Imagine being an HR professional and juggling
100 tasks from screening
candidates to answering their never ending queries.
Now, imagine a round the clock assistant
who can work tirelessly 24/7,
answering candidates questions while
efficiently finishing the onboarding paperwork.
That is the power of AI agents in HR.
But who are these AI agents?
Well, think of them as your virtual assistants,
which are created by generative AI with
a mission to automate the never ending loop of HR tasks.
Whether it is to screen resumes,
schedule interviews, or draft
the onboarding paperwork for a new hire.
AI agents use natural language processing or
NLP and deep learning to
streamline all your HR processes.
AI agents are not just your task masters,
but also wired to prioritize and delegate.
They break down complex instructions into well-defined,
clear ones to help you
achieve the projected deadlines efficiently.
They use advanced AI algorithms to optimize
resource allocation and prioritize
tasks based on urgency and importance.
Additionally, AI agents have
the expertise to personalize and provide
every candidate with a tailed experience to
support and assist them
throughout their onboarding journey.
AI agents are designed to work
in some specific scenarios as well.
For example, recruitment chatbots
are the most in demand as virtual assistant.
They manage the inquiries put up by
the applicant and schedule interviews
based on the necessary information collected.
Virtual interview assistants are
AI power tools that assess
the candidate skills and evaluate
whether they are a cultural fit for the organization.
This is done by organizing
video interviews with the applicant,
which streamlines the hiring process largely.
Next, there are employee onboarding tools
that guide new hires through
the onboarding process and provide them with
necessary resources and assistance whenever needed.
These tools address the numerous questions.
New hires usually have to ensure a smooth transition.
Another example is HR help desks that act as
virtual HR managers and
attend to employees queries about benefits,
policies, and company culture.
This takes a big load off the HR team members.
Let's get acquainted with some of
these AI superheroes now.
Meet Scout, the recruitment powerhouse
who sifts through other quickly.
It analyzes candidates based on their skills, experience,
and keywords to shortlist the qualified one sufficiently,
thereby saving HR professionals quite a lot of time.
Then there is Willow, your onboarding buddy
that makes the transition of every new hire as
smooth as possible by being available
24/7 and answering all the questions
a new joiner might have.
Sage is the performance whisperer that not only
helps HR by performance analysis of employees,
but also aids the employees by recommending
relevant training programs and
identifying trends and areas of improvement.
Then there is Retain,
the AI retention agent that vigilantly
monitors employee sentiment to prevent turnover.
It also proactively addresses
concerns to ensure employee satisfaction.
With these AI agents at your disposal,
it's not just about handling the HR tasks better,
but also about creating
a happier and more productive workforce.
But an often asked question is,
what about the human touch?
Well, these agents are not a replacement,
but rather an enhancement that elevates
efficiency and reduces the workload of HR professionals.
These agents are like trusted superheroes
that enable HR professionals to devote
more of their time towards strategic initiatives
and create a work environment built on empathy.
In this video, you learned how the rise of
AI agents has transformed the world of HR.
You also learned that these AI agents
streamline HR processes,
such as screening resumes, scheduling interviews,
and creating onboarding paperwork
through NLP and deep learning.

# What Is a Digital Employee?

Welcome to what is a digital employee.
After watching this video,
you will be able to explain what
a digital employee means and
how a digital employee can help the human workforce.
Digital employees are software-driven entities
designed to autonomously
handle end-to-end work processes.
They leverage a diverse set of skills to
perform various tasks and responsibilities,
which can differ based on their job role,
industry, and the goals
set by their managers or employers.
Digital employees have four key characteristics;
they can interact with the physical environment
in meaningful ways.
They can communicate and operate
across multiple channels,
ensuring seamless integration and interaction.
They can manage and optimize workflows
across different processes and systems.
They are designed to interact with all users,
providing consistent support and
engagement across various touch points.
These unique features make digital employees a
versatile and powerful addition to the modern work force.
Let's look at a video that explains a simple example
on how a digital employee can save hours of manual work.
This allows HR professionals to focus on
higher-value strategic tasks and make
more thoughtful recommendations
for better decision-making.
Hi, everybody, let's talk about digital employees.
I'm Leslie Chau with IBM Automation.
What is a digital employee?
What can it do for you?
What value does it bring to the human work force?

Let's start by looking at an example:
like Cassie who is a recruiter.
She helps people like Ava.
Ava is a manager,
and her looking to hire for a team.
Cassie helps Ava with the end-to-end hiring process.
Among other things that she does,
she helps Ava look for candidates for her job.
Her typical work flow looks something like this;
she starts by using
LinkedIn Recruiter to search
for and find the right candidates for the job.
She then goes through the search results
and finds matching candidates
that are qualified for the job.
She then messages these candidates and schedules
a screening interview to
make sure that they are the right match for Ava.
Then finally, when she has
the right list of shortlisted candidates,
she compiles that list into
a spreadsheet so that Ava can proceed to the next step.
Now, Cassie wants to spend more of her time doing this.
These are higher-value tasks;
like reviewing resumes or thoughtfully preparing
for the screening interview so that she
can have a best set of candidates for Ava.
She also knows that as a recruiter,
this is where she can really flex her skills,
instead, she spends most of
her day on manual and repetitive tasks.
These are things like combing
through a list of candidates in the search results.
Later in the process,
when she has come up with the short list of candidates,
she spends a lot of her time copy-pasting.
She copy-paste information from LinkedIn into
the spreadsheet to prepare that for Ava to review.
She also spends a lot of
her time in administrative tasks,
like messaging Ava, messaging the candidates,
and scheduling time with the candidates.
That would be great if Cassie had
her own personal helper that can
help her do these manual tasks so
that she can focus on some of
these more higher-value tasks that
really require the human skills,
the intuition, and the analytics.
This is where digital employee comes in.
I like you to meet Henry.
He is an HR digital employee and Cassie's new side kick.
Digital employees have three main functions.
First, it can interact with the world around it.
Second, it has AI,
and it can interpret what's being asked to do.
Finally, it can do work,
but just like human employees,
digital employees have a set of job skills.

For digital employees, these are
essentially API calls and software robotics.
These skills help the digital employee interact
with systems such as
LinkedIn and spreadsheets on behalf of
Cassie so that all Cassie has to do is ask.
Cassie asked Henry to do something,
but Henry in turn uses this AI to interpret it.
He then match it to the skills that it
has to do the work for Cassie.
In this example, Cassie can simply ask
Henry to do the searching for the candidates in LinkedIn.
Now, Henry can interpret that
and quickly match it to the LinkedIn skill that it has.
It'll call the LinkedIn API to do the search.
It can even go one step
further and message the right candidates
and schedule the time for Cassie to
go have the screening interviews with the candidates.
Later on in the process,
Cassie can ask Henry to take
the short list of candidates and
compile them in a list in the spreadsheet.
Henry will interpret that and match
it to its spreadsheet skill.
It will manually copy-paste each and every
row of the shortlist into the spreadsheet,
and can even go as signal to
Ava when that list is ready for her to review.

This was a very simple example,
but it shows you how a digital employee
can help Cassie save hours of time of manual work.
Now, Cassie can focus
more of her attention on higher-value work,
and where she can spend
more of her time now reviewing resumes and
thoughtfully preparing for those interviews so that
she can come up with a better list of candidates for Ava.
She can even start differentiating herself now from
her peers by writing thoughtful recommendations to Ava,
so that she can make a better decision in the next steps.
